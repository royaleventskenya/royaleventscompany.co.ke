      <p>Hosts often stress over details that guests barely notice—while overlooking the things that really matter. Here’s what stands out most to your attendees:</p>

      <h2>1. The Welcome Experience</h2>
      <p>Guests remember how they felt when they walked in. Warm greetings and smooth check-in make all the difference.</p>

      <h2>2. Food & Drinks</h2>
      <p>A great menu always leaves a lasting impression, while poor catering can overshadow even the most beautiful décor.</p>

      <h2>3. Entertainment & Energy</h2>
      <p>Good music and engaging entertainment keep guests talking long after the event is over.</p>

      <h2>4. Comfort & Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Seating, restrooms, and ease of movement matter more than the color of flowers or tablecloths.</p>

      <h2>5. What They Don’t Notice</h2>
      <p>Minor décor flaws, slight delays, or mismatched cutlery rarely get remembered. People recall feelings, not perfection.</p>

      <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Focus on comfort, food, and atmosphere—and relax about the tiny details. At Royal Events Kenya, we help you prioritize what matters most to your guests.</p>
